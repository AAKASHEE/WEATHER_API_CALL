I 've created a modular Weather App with the following structure:

Components:

SearchBar: Handles user input
WeatherDisplay: Renders weather information
Services:

weatherApi: Manages API calls
Types:

weather.ts: TypeScript interfaces for weather data
To use the app:

Replace YOUR_API_KEY in weatherApi.ts with your OpenWeatherMap API key
Enter a city name and click Search
View the weather information including temperature, humidity, and conditions
The app features error handling, TypeScript support, and a clean UI with Tailwind CSS.

prerequirements:
